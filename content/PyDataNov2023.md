# PyData Skopje Meetup - Nov. 23 2023 | 18:00
----


Join us this Thursday for the latest PyData Meetup in a while, this time around the meet up will be held in Base42, a local hackerspace in Skopje.

There will be two interesting talks on very different but very important topics - building cross-platform models with ONNX and a general overview of dependency management in Python, held by Aleksandar Ivanovski and Tomislav Ignjatovski, software engineers at CodeChem.

Here's a short intro into the topics and the speakers:

## But it works on my machine?! ONNX 101

----

In the dynamic world of machine learning, interoperability across frameworks and platforms is paramount. Enter Open Neural Network Exchange (ONNX), a game-changing initiative that empowers data scientists and developers to seamlessly move models between various deep learning frameworks. In this concise talk, we'll embark on a journey into the fundamentals of ONNX, shedding light on its key concepts, benefits, and practical applications.

## Python Dependency Management
----

Python's vibrant ecosystem relies on diverse package managers to simplify the complex landscape of dependencies and software distribution. This abstract provides an overview of package managers in the Python ecosystem, exploring their roles in managing project dependencies, version control, and environment isolation.
